# Title
Convex Polygon Maximization-Based Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction Algorithm

# Abstract
Pure endmember extraction from the hyperspectral image is a very essential step in target detection, classification and unmixing applications. Using the concept of convex geometry, a novel algorithm for endmember extraction is proposed in this paper. The algorithm uses convex polygon maximization to determine a convex set that gives maximum convex polygon area according to the surveyor’s formula. The parallel implementation of the proposed algorithm is useful in finding more effective distinctive pixels. The robustness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of noise is demonstrated with synthetic data. The simulation results, conducted using real hyperspectral data, indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces the Spectral Angle Error (SAE) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) error by 2.4–8.8%. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in abundance mapping is also validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE of the proposed algorithm is also improved by 1.7–7.6%.
